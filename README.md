# Sky-Wars

This game has been developed using WebGL and three.js. This game is heavily inspired by the *Sky Force* game. To run it in your computer, follow the following instructions:
* git clone https://github.com/harshita130602/Skyforce-Game
* cd Skyforce-Game
* Open the index.html with Live Server through Visual Studio code.

Use the following keys to play the game:-
* W - To proceed in UP direction
* A - To proceed in left direction
* S - To proceed in right direction
* D - To proceed in Down direction

Instead of missiles, I have used 'Powerballs'. To use powerballs, press 'SPACE'
